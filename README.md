# NFCHelperKit
The `NFCHelperKit` class in iOS simplifies NFC operations like reading, writing, and securing tags with password protection. It provides single-line methods for complex actions, making NFC integration and usage efficient and user-friendly making it more accesible for developers of all levels. 

I am currently adding all functionalities that are supported by the iOS CoreNFC Infrastructure. I will soon add the integrated functions like readTag(), writeTag(data), lockTag, addPasswordToTag(password), removePassword(password), eraseTag() etc. Please be patient :)

In the mean while I have uploaded the current version of the code. (It is still very rough and unpolished. But if you need a part of this urgently you can use snippets from the code. //avoid the readTag part for now as it will probably not work as it not dynamic at all right now. Will complete that first.)
